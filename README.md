Introduction

Welcome to BegrotingTool (Budgeting Tool)! This C# application is designed to help you calculate the net income from the gross income. This tool is perfect for anyone looking to manage their finances or understand the breakdown of their earnings after taxes and deductions.

Motivation
The primary motivation behind creating BegrotingTool was to enhance my coding skills while creating something practical and useful. I found the idea of a tool that simplifies the process of calculating net income from gross income intriguing and wanted to challenge myself to develop it.

Features
Gross to Net Calculation: Easily input your gross income and let BegrotingTool calculate the net income after deductions.
Customizable Deductions: Adjust deductions such as taxes, insurance, or any other applicable fees to reflect your specific financial situation.
User-Friendly Interface: The application features a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users of all levels to navigate and utilize.

Dependencies
BegrotingTool has no external dependencies. It's built purely with C# using .NET framework.

Work in Progress
Please note that BegrotingTool is still a work in progress. While it provides basic functionality for calculating net income from gross income, it may not be optimized or written in clean code standards yet. Expect to find areas that could be improved, refactored, or optimized for better performance and readability.
